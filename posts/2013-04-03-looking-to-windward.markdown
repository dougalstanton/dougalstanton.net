One of my absolute favourite authors, Iain (M) Banks, has announced he has
late-stage cancer and is not expected to live out the year.

While he is making the most of his final months with family and friends the
rest of the literary world is mourning him. This will no doubt come as a
slight shock to him, but it isn't surprising to me. He wrote some
*exceedingly good books*.

Meanwhile the rest of us will maybe try to [grasp that wheel harder] [1].
