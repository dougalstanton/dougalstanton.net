title: A capoeira weekend in Drumnadrochit

I'm just getting ready for weekend up north with the [M&atilde;o no
Ch&atilde;o people and Dion] [1]. I've got some bread getting ready, the
hallway is piled high with an unsorted collection of things I could take
including a tent and sleeping bags. I'm trying to work out if it's
possible to book train tickets home that are not eye-wateringly expensive.
(The answer would appear to be "no".)

The weather in Drumnadrochit says "rain" so a tent will probably not be so
fun. I suspect thick socks and shoes might actually be more prudent,
though we don't plan on going for long walks.

I also have to think about getting something for lunch! Right, better get
back to that bread, it'll need worked a bit more and there's no time to
lose.
