Several years ago I was reading _Jane Eyre_ while staying at a friend's
house prior to us all attending a wedding nearby. The night before the
wedding I was very ill --- and spent the night vomiting loudly to prove
it. The next day while the others were at the wedding I lay in bed,
dozing and reading my book.

After book group this weekend I decided to re-read _The Eyre Affair_, a
comedy detective novel which uses _Jane Eyre_ as a principal plot point.
On Tuesday morning I was again violently ill and spent the next day in
bed, drifting in and out of sleep and reading.

Now I don't want to start pointing fingers or naming names here but
there's something quite suspicious about all this and in future I'll be
laying off _Jane Eyre_ and _Jane Eyre_ derivatives for the sake of my
health.
