Okay so probably not as exciting for you as it is for me, but
today I had one of those little victories that's worth writing
about.

Today I managed a couple of really lengthy handstands which were
totally unsupported. One of them I actually had to stop because
nothing was going to happen to stop it otherwise. Now honestly I
don't know what the actual measurement would have been but I'm
guessing at least ten seconds of freestanding inversion without
overshooting.

In the last fortnight I'd been slightly worried that I was reaching
a plateau so I've been trying to force new difficulties into my
five minutes. The first being, obviously, doing them well away from
the wall so I risk overshooting. The second is making them
harder by going in sideways --- more of a cartwheel entrance rather
than face-on. This is more capoeira-focused so I've also been trying
to *not* look at the ground as I place my hands but to keep my eyes
on my imaginary opponent.

Between all these things I've managed to push through the stage last
week where I thought I was stagnating --- to produce exciting new
freestanding developments. Just from five minutes every day.
