You might have seen in the news that there was a fire at
a school in Glasgow. What you might not have known was that
this school was also where [Mao No Chao Glasgow] [mnc] trained
every Thursday evening at 6.30.

I've not been down to see the building, or at least what remains
of it, but the fire was going basically all day so I suspect
there isn't much left but the stone exterior walls. And they'll
be too damaged for the building to be deemed sound I would guess.

As a group we have often spoken of trying to find new premises
but it's very easy not to put in effort or make decisions when
you have something. This fire has forced our hand and we've
already had serious discussions about a couple of venues nearby.

By next Thursday I hope I'll be able to say "we have tried one
new training area", and maybe we'll have tried out another not
long after that. It would be great to end somewhere that gives
us more visibility to fitness types (like a real gym) or that is
in an easily accessible place. 

Here's to us, rising from the ashes!
