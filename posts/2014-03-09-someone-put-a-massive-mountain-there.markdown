Situation report from the scene, live as it happens! It's 6pm on the end
of my first day in the French Alps. The sun was bright and if the
weather continues like this I'm going to be wearing a lot less on the
slopes than I initially thought.

I spent the morning and afternoon with [&Eacute;cole du Ski
Frani&ccedil;ais] [esf] as an "adulte debutant" --- ie, adult beginner.
I'm slowly dredging up bits of French and learning new words (_batons_
for ski poles and _casque_ for helmet). The instructors would translate
things into English but on many occasions it wasn't necessary.

For lunch I had croque monsieur, frites avec mayonnaise and biere. Again
I tried to be quite confident and the words more or less made sense to
everyone so that's quite good.

It seems unlikely I will be able to co-ordinate a lunchtime meeting with
Helen and her family as I'm totally without phone service both in the
village and in the mountains. Hopefully we're organise something in
advance one day, although at the moment I'm still pretty much clueless
about getting around. It'll have to be a really obvious and central
meeting point or I won't have a clue.
