title: Thoughts from the saddle

We're finally making it out of winter --- in fact, I believe
this is the vernal equinox? --- and it's no longer pitch dark
when I leave work. Just in time for the lighter evenings, we
both had the front lights from our bikes stolen on Monday
evening.

I've seen a lot of suggestions for different styles of bike
lights in the last couple of years, and now I'm obviously in
the market for something new. My previous front light was very
difficult to whip on and off the bike, which is why I tended
to leave it there. I won't make that mistake again. I've even
seen suggestions for indicator lights for bikes, though the
problem with cyclists is we don't have **width** and so drivers
look right through us. So not only do they not really see us
whether we've got lights on or not, but indicators wouldn't be
mounted far enough apart to be very obvious at a distance. I
suppose if you had a big 2D array of LEDs hanging off the back
of the saddle with an animated arrow it might do something.

But really I don't think the issue is one of clouded intent --- 
if anybody cares to look they should see my road position (much 
more obvious when you're a tiny fraction of the lane width),
the direction I'm looking and that I'm frequently checking behind
me. All this even *if* it is unsafe to indicate with my
hands. (The two occasions I've been thrown from my bike by
potholes I had only one hand steering because I was indicating
with the other. I now only indicate when obviously safe to do
so.)

Drivers don't often take the time to look and that is where the
real problem lies. Forethought and patience seem to be thin on
the ground sometimes too. The number of drivers who appear to
wait until pinch points in the road --- traffic islands, delivery
vans stopped on narrow streets, etc --- before overtaking never
ceases to amaze.

Last month I experimented with taking a shorter train journey and
a correspondingly longer bike ride when commuting to work. This
provided financial savings but the risk to my life seemed to fly
out of control. One car driver tried to nudge me out of the way
as I exited a roundabout. A bus driver tried to run me off the
road twice in one journey (once on a narrow bridge, once at a 
traffic island --- see a theme?). I made a complaint to [Stuarts
of Carluke] [bus] and though the man was very apologetic on the
phone I doubt anything came of it. I've gone back to the longer
train journey.
