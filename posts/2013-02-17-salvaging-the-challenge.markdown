Since losing the old blog host I've been trying to reclaim what I could
from the Wayback Machine, particularly archives of Helen's blog.

There aren't enough entries saved to cover the whole year, even if we
ignore the entries which aren't part of the challenge. Which basically
means we've lost the record of the challenge and frankly I'm gutted by
this state of affairs.

I have 67 saved entries and there should be about 190, though some of
those will be links to the same article. This is still a lot of missing
posts.

At this point I'm beginning to wonder if saving those 67 is worth it.
I'm quite demoralised.
