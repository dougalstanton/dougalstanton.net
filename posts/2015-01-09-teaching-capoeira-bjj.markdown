It's been about two months now since I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so I've got a better understanding of how it's being taught now.

I'm really impressed with the teaching at Cross Combat, and I can tell it's something that William and his team take a fair amount of pride in. It seems to rely on a few fundamentals:

*   Focus on one thing per class
*   Building technique piecemeal
*   Progressive resistance

Nothing that seems outlandish, unusual or revolutionary but the reality is that it's *productive*. On top of this there is some philosophical approach which emphasises exploration and flow over exacting instruction.

The attitude is very similar to the teaching in capoeira (at least, in M&atilde;o No Ch&atilde;o) but the actual teaching is very different structure is very different. We definitely *don't* focus on a single thing during a lesson --- a scattergun approach would be a more accurate description.

I think we try for progressive resistance but miss the full value. We can start off very collaborative but there's no steady progression from there. A predictable next step for each level of resistance would be valuable to have: in this way it's always obvious how the other person will react. On that topic a prohibition against _malicia_ and _malandragem_ during training until it's explicitly allowed. Indeed, that is a level of resistance that can be saved for an actual game.

It's the end of the Christmas holidays and several weeks since I've done any capoeira or been to a class. I'm going to rethink everything I have written here in light of what we actually do the next time I train.
