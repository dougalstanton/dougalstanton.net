After the loss of my old blog, which I hope to at least salvage
from the Wayback Machine at some point, I've moved over to using
Octopress which has the built-in advantage of backed-up posts.

I shouldn't be able to lose it all again.

(What is it about backing up data? You never do it until you've
been burned once? I think that seems about right. Everyone is
invincible until the first time they are laid low.)

Soon I will get my domain redirected here, so while things are
interrupted they will not be interrupted forever.
