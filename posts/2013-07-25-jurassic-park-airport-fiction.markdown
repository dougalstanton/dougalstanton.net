title: Jurassic Park: airport fiction when dinosaurs ruled the bestsellers
tags: book
---
As a little chap I distinctly remember enjoying Jurassic Park on the big
screen. I think it was one of those defining blockbuster movies of my
youth, like everybody remembers seeing Star Wars for the first time. And
in some sense it was just as revolutionary for the use of computer
graphics. Those dinos looked _real!_

The book is a proper disappointment, falling squarely into the category of
stories that get much better when translated to film. Michael Crichton was
a prolific writer of works that would eventually get adapted to the screen
--- maybe they all needed someone else to clean up his terrible dialogue?

Whenever I read a book now I come back to Christopher Brookmyre's BDQ:

The issue of consistency in suspension of disbelief is paramount. It is
the downfall of many a bad movie. _Prometheus_, for example, repeatedly
set up characters as leaders in their field who made basic mistakes. in a
high technology world which was simultaneously less capable than our own.

Jurassic Park has these failings and more besides. There are a number of
"experts" in paleontology, genetics, mathematics and zoo management who
have manage to come out with some real howlers. Geneticists who can't
remember where they got their DNA from. Park management who can't remember
how to reboot the park management system after it fails.

What really gets my goat is the inconsistency in character. From one scene
to the next characters will change personality drastically so that the
stupid thing they do to move the plot along seems reasonable. The nine
year-old girl who was rocking back and forth in terror is now complaining
about lack of ice cream or wanting to play with the walkie-talkie. In case
it had escaped your attention there's a velociraptor in the hallway. But
the plot dictates the raptor find the kids so rather than stay quiet and
frightened they have to squabble over who gets to play with this new toy.

This inconsistency appears again and again, and each time it does the urge
to fling the book across the room rises. Frankly, they should all have
been eaten.
