title: I barely even read email any more
---
I'm subscribed to a handful of mailing lists for projects and programming
languages that I have worked with in the past. I receive stuff from the
usual online sellers plus the newsletters of local theatres, venues and
community groups.

Every single one of these gets deleted without even being opened. Why am I
bothering to receive them? Why, in fact, do I even sign up for them in the
first place?

I think I will go on an unsubscribing spree to reduce the load. Ideally I
would like all my email to come directly into my main inbox (rather than
being pre-filtered into other folders) but that everything in there to be
directly relevant to me. And the vast majority of it from people I
actually know in real life.

Edit: After a couple of days of following the unsubscribe option for
everything that came into my inbox it's all looking much nicer already.
And most sites don't require you to remember a password to remove yourself
from their mailing list, which is a bonus.
