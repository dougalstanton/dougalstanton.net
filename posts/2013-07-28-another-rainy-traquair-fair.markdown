I'm just back from another Traquair Fair. I went to my first Traquair
Fair two years ago and it rained quite heavily. There wasn't one last
year but in case I thought the 2011 rainfall was a freak occurence it
happened again. Rain, wet tents, muddy dancing and drinking cider in
the dark. We must be getting old though --- no midnight trip to the
maze.

We played some capoeira on the Saturday while the sun was beating down.
We had a reasonable crowd at one point though they still wouldn't
"crowd" us. Even when we want them to form a tight circle around the
action everyone hides off to the side. We need to concentrate on "street
performance banter" to rally crowds and tell them what to do, where to
sit and how to enjoy themselves. I think that would make for a more
meaningful show.

So while we were programmed for a "Capoeira Dance Workshop" we ended up
with a ninety minute capoeira game with some crowd interaction and an
attempt to get people to clap or even sing. Enjoyable, especially on the
lawn in the sun, in front of Traquair House, but not what it *could*
have been.

The rains held off until we were finished and packing the instruments
back up. The deluge when it came was pretty all-consuming though...
