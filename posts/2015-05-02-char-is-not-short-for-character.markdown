title: Char is (probably) not short for Character

I was reading an online discussion recently about the pronunciation of "char" as it appears in C source code. For the non-programmers, the keyword "char" is used to indicate a character (eg, letter or number) in code, like this:

~~~c
char my_initial = 'D';
~~~

Some people pronounce this keyword as it appears, _char_ (as in to blacken by burning). Others pronounce it more like _car_ with a hard /k/ since it's short for _character_. But it occured to me that the vowel sound in _car_ and in _character_ are different --- at least they are in my accent!

I looked them up and they appear different in IPA rendering too: /&#593;/ in _car_ and /a/ in _character_.

I'm personally fond of pronouncing it like _char_, but if I wanted to go with the alternative could I learn to pronounce _car_ with a different vowel sound? How weird would I sound?
