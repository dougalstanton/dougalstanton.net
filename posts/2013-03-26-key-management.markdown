title: Key management (in the real world)
---
There isn't really a solution to having too many keys. You just
have to make one mistake with that jailer's bunch that you haul
around everywhere --- and suddenly you can't get into your house,
you can't open up at work, you can't unlock your bike, and so on
until you begin to wonder: why haven't we solved this yet?

Thankfully this hasn't happened to me, but it has happened very
recently to someone that I know. And I'm conscious that I do have
a fairly large bunch of keys with me at all times, which is a
liability.

There's not even a comfortable way to carry them in my pocket
without jabbing myself in the leg. I'd love to leave most of them
at home; maybe have some kind of thumb-print access for the flat
or something. Or voice recognition, that would be good (until it
doesn't work).
