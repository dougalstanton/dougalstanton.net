title: The unreasonable effectiveness of programming to Get Stuff Done&trade;

I'm not going to try convincing you of anything here, but instead to
lay out the facts of what just happened.

I have a list of "readers' favourite books" that was the result of a popular
vote a few years ago (in the Guardian I think, though that doesn't matter at
this point).

I was also given a list of books for Kindle that someone at work had access
to, by means which we shall not explore in detail. *wink*

I thought, I wonder how many of the favourite books are available? One list looked like this:

    1 Pride and Prejudice Jane Austen
    2 The Lord of the Rings JRR Tolkien
    3 Jane Eyre Charlotte Bronte
    4 Harry Potter series JK Rowling
    5 To Kill a Mockingbird Harper Lee
    ...

and the other looked like this:

    Abagnale, Frank W. - Catch Me If You Can.mobi
    Abbot, Edwin - Flatland.mobi
    Abercrombie, Joe - First Law 01 - The Blade Itself.mobi
    Abercrombie, Joe - First Law 02 - Before They Are Hanged.mobi
    Abercrombie, Joe - First Law 03 - Last Argument of Kings.mobi
    ...

A few minutes later I had a good answer on my screen. I won't go into
the details because they're neither interesting or relevant. (I took the
last word from the first list, which was the author's surname, and searched
for it in the other list. Any book which produced no candidates was dropped
entirely. The rest were printed.) The point is that I had the means and the 
ability to very quickly answer the following question:

> Out of this list of 100 books and this list of 1400 books,
> which ones match up?

The results were by no means perfect (this sample below shows the fuzzy
nature of the output) but they were good enough to eyeball and say "yep,
the book is there" or not.

This is why programming ability will one day become an important skill
for living in a technological society. It may not be as fundamental as
reading and writing, but few things are. Driving a car, wiring a plug,
painting a fence --- all things further down the scale but still 
considered by many as "life skills". Unless there is a powerful change in
the way computers can be made to understand our desires in the next few
years then I think "simple scripting" will also fall into that category.
