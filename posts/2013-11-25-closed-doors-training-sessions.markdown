We've finallly got a space for training capoeira on Tuesdays in Glasgow,
but neither Nick or Piolho can commit until at least the new year so
we're going to use it as a "private" session for extra practice rather
than a formal teaching opportunity. It'll just be a few of us going over
what we did in previous lessons and getting the chance to play more
often.

It looks like the first time around will have only 3 attendees, which is
an awkward number for a paired activity.

There are some things I want to work on, either just for myself or
because I think it will be an interesting thing to explore. I want to
look at some of the strategic sides of the game --- possession of space,
[corpo fechado] [closed] and creative thinking. I think using the money
game to explore the first idea is interesting because it's all about
controlling a specific area of play.

I'm also thinking about a kind of "musical statues" thing to encourage
thinking about stability and protective postures but that's something I
want to flesh out in my head more before I suggest it to others.

But first I think we should just start with the basics: a
straight-forward sequence and some extended play. I must remember to
pack the pandeiro.
