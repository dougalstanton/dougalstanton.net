title: Life as a game, measured in blog posts and coffee spoons

I've tried in the past to get into tools like [Fitocracy] [fit], whose
gimmick is to make exercise a game in which you increase your high score
by recording the physical workouts you do. I failed to get much
satisfaction out of it for a couple of key reasons:

*   My cycling doesn't really change, so while I do about 9 miles a day it
    never goes above that. The total miles covered keeps going up, which
    does afford more points, but I feel a bit of a fraud all along. I'm
    not getting faster and I'm not increasing my distance either.
*   Capoeira is a dynamic skill-based activity which does not lend itself
    to measurement with simple numbers like distance, time, mass or speed.
    To use an analogy, if I could run around really fast and hit tennis
    balls really hard neither of these would demonstrate I was progressing
    at tennis. Similarly someone with a less impressive serve and a slower
    dash could still trounce me if they had actual tennis experience.

I still have a Fitocracy account but I don't do things which measure
easily so I never use it.

[game] to diverse aspects of life.
