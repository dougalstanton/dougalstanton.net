title: Aaargh! Public speaking

Recently there have been a few presentations at work, including one on
the two languages [Python] [] and [Lua] []. These are both [dynamically
typed languages] [types] and as you might know I'm a static typing kinda
guy.  It seemed reasonable to take this opportunity to get some public
speaking practice while providing a counterpoint to this recent
languages talk.

[python]: <http://www.python.org> "The Python Programming Language"
[lua]: <http://www.lua.org> "The Lua Programming Language"
[types]: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system> "Type systems"

The language we use at work is C++ with a bit of legacy C and some
assembly in the darker corners. This is a wee bit object-oriented and
very imperative --- a whole world away from the Haskell that I would
more than likely use as my example language.

(Other topics suggested by my colleagues were capoeira and software
engineering in an independent Scotland. I'm trying to work out how I can
make a few "functional programming in an independent Scotland" jokes but
there's nothing forthcoming. The obvious "separation of Church and
state" joke isn't relevant here!)

The issues which I *could* discuss are numerous, and there's plenty of
things I'd like to talk about that are not introductory. So sticking to
the basics, I have some themes and topics:

*       Functions, procedures, side-effects. Some definitions.
*       Purity & referential transparency. Haskell is a language of
        extremes (the "hair shirt") so we may as well discuss the
        advantages of this full-on expression-based approach to
        programming.
*       The benefits of an expressive type system. Not an FP-specific
        thing but it gives an opportunity to show one of Haskell's
        strengths.
*       Laziness and the duality of data structures and control
        structures. Might be a bit mind-bending but nobody said it was
        going to be easy.
*       History of Turing machines and Lambda calculus. Not sure if it
        can be worked in without sounding too much like a lecture but it
        would help to push the idea that this is a fundamentally
        different approach to the problem of programming but at the same
        time it is just as powerful.

I think I just need to start writing and see what I can come up with.
Rearrange, edit, and so on --- until I'm done.
