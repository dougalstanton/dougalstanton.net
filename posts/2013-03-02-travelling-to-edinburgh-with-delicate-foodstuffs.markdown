For our (approximately) monthly (kind of) book group we visit everyone's
flat in rotation and we're the only people who don't live in Edinburgh
but still attend, so we do a lot of travelling to Edinburgh.

The Glasgow underground trains stop at about 6.30pm on a Sunday so we
generally take our bikes at least some of the distance so we can cycle
back to the flat when we get back to Glasgow Queen Street station.

So we have to come up with food which travels well, and can cope with
being beaten a bit on the back of a bike. But no! Tomorrow we're going to
try a new trick. First we cycle to the train station (which handily has
both subway and intercity train services) and get the underground back
to the flat, with a return ticket. Then we take the food, carefully, on
the underground back out to the station and go to Edinburgh.

When we return in the evening we will have only empty dishes and can hop
on the bikes heading home. It's a bit of extra to-ing and fro-ing but I
suspect it will work admirably.
