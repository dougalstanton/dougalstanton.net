title: The world discovers that programming is not easy
tags: programming, excel, economics

It has recently been shown that [a 2010 economics paper built around an
Excel spreadsheet contained an important error] [bug], and this error came
from the code in the spreadsheet itself. To be exact, some conclusions of
the paper hinged on a spreadsheet bug.

So it becomes clear to the world at large that Excel spreadsheets are
programming, and being programming they will almost definitely contain
bugs.

I have a particular interest here because I believe that programming
should be something more widely taught and understood. Part of this
greater understanding and familiarity will of course hammer home a truth
understood by programmers all over the world: it's very easy to make a
mistake which doesn't show up until too late.
