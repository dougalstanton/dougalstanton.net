It's been ages since I finished a book. I'm having real trouble sticking
to it right now but I'm not sure why. I guess everything I pick up isn't
engaging me but that doesn't answer the question why my current threshold
for engagement is so high.

So I'm happy to state that I finished [Lost at Sea by Bryan Lee O'Malley]
[las], who is also the author of the Scott Pilgrim series. (Which for the
record I haven't read or seen the film, I just found this fact
interesting.) I enjoyed it greatly. It's about a girl discovering some
friends on an accidental road trip and deals with the important issues of
the day --- whether cats can steal your soul, that kind of thing.

And it's a graphic novel/comic and short, which goes more than some way to
explain why I managed to finish it. It probably only has about 20 pages
worth of text, but the medium doesn't require many words. It's unlikely I
can claim that each picture adds another thousand to the word count.
