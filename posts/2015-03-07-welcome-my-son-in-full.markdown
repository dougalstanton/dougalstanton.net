Just over a year ago we saw [Phil, of Spotted Stripes Circus fame, perform the beginnings of something built on the story of Frankenstein] [preview]. On the first of March I had the considerable pleasure of seeing the first public performance of _Welcome my Son_.

There was a feedback form, so this is a record of what I wrote.

> Was there any single element that particularly stood out
> positively?
>
> The physical characterisation of the 'monster' was fantastic,
> particularly the involuntary jerks and convulsions. It was
> uncomfortable to watch (I found myself flinching in sympathy)
> and amazing to see that combined with the control to manage it
> while still hanging on a pole or balancing on the scaffold.

> Was there any single element that stood out negatively?

> The transition from the physical theatre at the start, with
> just the subtlest of sounds to support it, to a traditional
> soliloquy, was a bit jarring at first. I hadn't expected it so
> I took a minute to adjust to the change in pace.

> Overall what would have made the performance better?
>
> The contrast between the two characters got a bit confused at
> the finale, when I wasn't totally clear who was speaking which
> part until it settled into a rhythm. If that were made clearer
> it might be easier to understand the climax as it happens
> rather than needing a moment to reflect on what is going on.

> Would you go and see this show again?
>
> I don't normally see shows again but I think if I were to go
> again I would enjoy re-examining what I saw and looking for new
> details.

> Would you recommend it to anyone else?
>
> I would definitely recommend this show --- indeed I have
> already recommended it to someone, though I was not able to say
> when or if it would next be performed.
