title: ComicBake: thoughts to words to comics!
---

Like comics? Like writing comics? Can't be bothered doing all that arty
stuff that goes along with writing comics? You need ComicBake!

ComicBake makes it easier for you, the frustrated artist in your cold
uncomfortable garret, to produce [constrained comics of unsurpassed
genius] [constrained] with the minimum of effort.

All you have to write is the text:

    Abraham: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

    Sampson: I do bite my thumb, sir.

The text is combined with images of _Abraham_ and _Sampson_ and the result
is a strip of action, pathos, comedy and deep insight. I promise.
