The samba rhythm forms a decay and then attack over the course of four
beats. The analogy of a bouncing ball works: the initial impact is the
first note, then a bounce for a second weaker impact then a third weaker
impact. The fourth beat is strong again and slightly independent of the
bouncing-ball analogy.

The gap between notes is not regular, again like a bouncing ball the time
between impacts is small after the first beat. Also the fourth beat is not
delayed but races ahead. All told this gives the racing and syncopated
feel rather than a regular metronomic beat.
