# S.P.A.M.

A B-side from _About 3am_ single (CD 2).

| Okay this is how it was(?)
| 
| He's staring down
| The sky is purple brown
| The top of the trees
| Rolling like the sea
| Yeah he's staring down
| Something lying on the ground
| 
| (sigh)
| 
| And all these stars(?) won't be a problem now
| Yeah, won't be a problem now
| 
| Yeah that's tracking(?) him down
| A black hand reaching for the ground
| The top of the trees
| Just rolling like the sea
| 
| Now for the other life
| And now for the other life --- the one without mistakes.
