title: Capoeira Training Diary

I'm just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I'm using
forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:

    Question / Response
    Defence  \ Attack

The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a
situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two
players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.

# 2013-03-21

Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and
variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are
played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.


    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
    O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
    C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular

Ginga with "breaks" --- _giro_ (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish),
_pulo_ (jump, from side to side), _chamada_ (facing off to one side, legs
together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).

Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then
entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then
drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the
other side.

Sequence:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
    Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia

Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead
staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change
direction until Left's foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to
turn into a chapa.

Variant 1:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Variant 2:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Right's QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs
to protect before spreading for the tesoura.


# 2013-04-04

Practise ginga: with a firm base and a light expressive top half; and with
an agile, light base and a solid top half.

Quite an intricate sequence starting from a chapa as a response to a fairly
open meia lua. The defender performs an esquiva in the same direction as the
kick, followed by a chapa (a) with the following leg, keeping weight where
it is, or (b) bringing the following leg in and kicking backwards with the
standing leg. (NB that (a) is close to but shouldn't turn into gancho --- be
more direct!)

    Meia lua               / Esquiva
    Jump back to negativa  \ Chapa (either leg)
    S-dobrado              / giro or au or ...

Defending the chapa is where it gets tricky. Moving from meia lua to leaping
back, shifting the weight and the rotation in the opposite direction. The
end position is a half-squat with the former kicking foot flat on the ground
and the standing leg outstretched on the ground. Making sure you're not
landing hand-first as you're quickly going to really hurt your wrist.


# 2013-04-12

Moving round in a circle --- walking forwards, backwards, deep lunging
steps, on all fours forwards, backwards, forwards but *really* low
(killer).

Fall back on one leg, the other forward, and au on the side of the forward
leg. Try to step from one hand to the other with the au.

Queda de tres with the supported side towards your opponent. Push off with
both feet and jump to the front, supported on your planted hand. Repeat
but the jump becomes a two-footed kick.

Small au stops midway and expands. Drop straight down so you are facing
the opposite way and repeat on the other side.

Sequence 1:

Simple sequence moving forward with tesoura and au, moving over the
opponent and asking a question --- as simple or as difficult as you want
to make it.

    Tesoura                      / Au, drop into queda de rins
    Au, drop into queda de rins  \ Tesoura

Sequence 2:

Another simple sequence. The first rabo de arraia just has to be enough to
force the esquiva. With enough skill it can just be a flick of the hips...

    Feint rabo de arraia                  / Esquiva
    Switch & rabo de arraia opposite side / Esquiva

Variations on _Chama eu Angola_, citing Pastinha or Besouro instead of
Angola.

> | Chama eu, chama eu
> | Chama eu Angola, chama eu

# 2013-04-19

Gentle ginga to warm up. With foot in rear position lower down into crouch
with rear foot on toe and front foot flat. Should be stable and mobile,
ready for esquiva, turn sideways, au etc. Stand and repeat on other side:
ginga then drop into crouch, rise again. Alternately, rise into a low base
without ginga, then into crouch; really hit those thighs hard.

When in crouch, role round the forward leg, keeping quite small and tight
rather than stretching the leg out. Repeat in both directions. In role
mid-point push backwards with both hands so you pivot over the anchored
leg and use the aerial leg to land in the same crouch position facing the
opposite way from your start position. (Can be done with two people
sliding past each other and repositioning around the perimeter of a small
circle.)

Esquiva with one hand down, bring feet together and spread feet again
facing the opposite direction. Protect and keep an eye on your partner
through your legs, switch to the other side. The forward leg is the
straight(er) leg as you drop into a crouch, side on to partner. From there
you can role into into tesoura or rabo de arraia.

A new song:

# 2013-04-21 Charity roda

*   Need to work on controlling level of engagment (ie 1,2,3) where 1 is
    only exploratory and not combative. Work on letting people move rather
    than always blocking. Encourage the flow of conversation rather than
    obstructing it. Spend more time having fun, collaborating...?
*   Related to that, work on the interplay between leading and following:
    learning to notice when I'm following (most of the time) and see if I
    do something about that.

# 2013-04-26

Some work on low ginga, moving slowly and maintaining a constant distance
and connection from each other. I really need to work on this sense of
flow and constant movement alongside the connectivity: it seems to be one
or another at the moment.

Kicking practice --- rabo de arraia, rabo de arraia sem m&atilde;o and
armada. Particular emphasis on minimising telegraph with rabo de arraia by
not stepping forward but spinning from the base of the ginga. Also armada
followed by bananeira on each side.

Sequence (might have been two mixed together, can't remember)

    Negativa left
    Swing foot in front and negativa to the right
    Bananeira to the right
    Land on right foot, step in with left foot
    Rabo de arraia with right foot

# 2013-05-02 First class in Overnewton

Injured left side so just played pandeiro and sang. Things to concentrate
on w.r.t. music:

*   Singing at the right time so the boom-ba matches up with the
    lyrics which typically contain a da-da rhythm themselves. Or remember
    at which point the singing is supposed to start. :-\
*   Getting the correct pitch for _Bahia de todos os santos_, particularly
    for the second line of each verse which goes up.

# 2013-05-09 Dion's class in Airdrie

Flexibility work: forward splits, rotation to forward splits facing the
other direction. Half ponte and straight-legged stretch (like a half ponte
or role but with legs out straight in a wide V, heels on the ground).

Flow work: moving across the ground with role/ginga, stop into bananeira, and
back to moving again.

Rabo de arraia then step back into bananeira. Upright alternative: rabo de
arraia then bring knee of kicking leg up and through. A knee, or a
threatened chapa, or a defence.

Chamada-style head-to-belly stance. Upright person leads and crouched
person has to follow while maintaining constant connection.

One person breaks into the other person's meia lua with a decisive butt to
the sternum. Hands up to protect on side of incoming leg.

    Meia lua de frente / cabecada

# 2013-05-11 Dion's workshop in Drumnadrochit

Lots of mobility work and relaxation emphasis. Ginga, "crocodile"
(travelling tesoura move, head and body low to ground), "lizard" (similar
but forward, with upward bend every few paces), "elephant"
(straight-legged backwards walk with body folded double and short steps).

Tesoura. Tesoura and au with one protecting from cabecada.

# 2013-05-24 Revision of Dion's teachings

Piolho away; Nick taking us through some of the work that Dion was doing
with us. In no particular order:

*   Ginga work. Two phases: the first ignores the body and concentrates on
    the legs, keeping things solid and deliberate.
    
    Exercises included (i) always being open (wide-legged stance, no
    crossing legs over), (ii) always crossing legs over (much spinning and
    standing with legs together, (iii) "exploration" of space by
    maintaining all your weight on the support leg until the last moment
    and then switching to the other leg.
    
    Second phase was to concentrate on upper half leaving legs alone to do
    their thing: sway first from the hips, then moving from the waist and
    chest, then finally bringing the shoulders and head in, to the point
    of leading with the head (chin first?).
*   Ponte work. Ponte rotation along a wall, choosing a horizontal line to
    follow and then return other way. Increase difficulty by choosing a
    lower line on the wall and placing your feet further from the wall. In
    essence, moving the body towards horizontal.

    Attempting similar moves from the ground. Lying back bring feet up
    underneath and take weight onto head/shoulders to get hands onto the
    ground and holding some weight.

    Otherwise starting from queda de rins take weight on head and try to
    spin hand on ground to be positioned "backwards".
*   Progressive cabecada and au, maintaining contact with the head
    throughout the au. Concentrate on the opponent not the ground during
    au!

Other thoughts for the lesson: think about decisiveness. Choosing whether
to go for a move or not, or to fake a move or not.

# 2013-05-30

As the previous week, revising things that Dion was teaching but from
Piolho's perspective this time.

*   Weight placement. Esquiva to one leg so that all of the weight is
    directly above it (don't twist the knee). Sinking on that knee while
    leaving the toes of the trailing foot on the ground leaves the
    greatest range of movement open. (If the weight is evenly distributed
    you have to shift it all in one direction to do anything.)

    Two ways of doing this. Either sink directly on leg while moving the
    other leg "out" (as if stepping under a kick). Or stepping back with
    the leg which will hold your weight and letting it collapse down. In
    both situations one leg takes all the weight, but the difference is
    whether it is the leg which moves or the leg that remains static.

    The direction of movement is also variable. With the weight on the
    static leg, moving forward allows you to esquiva under a kick or set
    up a rasteira. With the weight on the moving leg, moving forward
    is more like a cabecada while moving backward is a definite esquiva.

    Thinking about these moves had a positive effect on my game I felt and
    on my reactivity.

*   Cabecada. One exercise leaning head against partner's stomach, each
    leaning into the other similar to the chamada. Letting the bending
    person's head push the other around, keeping a straight back and neck.

    The other exercise is a meia lua interrupted by a cabecada to the
    sternum. Things to concentrate on include *slighty* turning away from
    the kicking leg for protection, and getting a good solid connection
    and push on the centre of the chest.

Sequence:

Things brings together a lot of the elements from above. The kick
interrupted by the cabecada, but this time Left receives the head with an
esquiva, stepping back and down onto the back leg, then switching weight
to the front leg to use back leg to kick. Right brings their back leg *in*
so both legs are together then drops their weight to "esquiva through"
underneath the rabo de arraia. (It is possible to step out to the side and
come back in with the cabecada instead of going inside.)

    Meia lua de frente / interrupt kick
    Esquiva backwards  \ with cabecada
    Rabo de arraia     / Esquiva
                       \ Step inside (or cabecada)

Done well this sequence has a nice sense of distance and elasticity though
I always end up too close at the end when stepping inside, which negates
the need for the cabecada but isn't so flexible or elegant.

And the lyrics to a couple of songs. This first one can also be _Angoleiro
sou eu_ instead of _Capoeira sou eu_. I don't know about the verses.

> | **Quem vem l&aacute;? --- Sou eu**
> |
> | Quem vem la? Sou eu
> | Quem vem la? Sou eu
> | Berimbau bateu
> | Capoeira sou eu

Second song, again no verse lyrics, sorry...

> | **Bal&atilde;o subiu, bal&atilde;o desceu**
> |
> | Balao subiu
> | Balao desceu

# 2013-06-04 First day in The SPACE

Some interesting new techniques from Dion's recent teaching which I hadn't
learned so presumably it's from his Sunday class in Drumnadrochit.

Starting with an esquiva --- leaning over to the right and placing the
left hand next to the right foot. Place the right hand "back" (away from
the opponent so that this hand forms a squint triangle on the floor with
the feet as the two other vertices. Move the extended leg in so it takes
the weight properly and bend so the hips get low to the ground. You want
to spin the body along a horizontal axis so the leg that was weight
bearing arcs over the top of the body --- sort of a rabo de arraia shifted
through ninety degrees. If the hips aren't low enough and the body not
flat enough it turns into a rabo de arraia.

Second we did some nice ground work from a base of queda de quatro by
shifting through the diagonal: fixing two opposite points (hand and foot)
and swapping the other two. This can be combined with esquiva for extra
movement and then back or onward to another square position. The nice
thing is maintaining the ratio of width/height of the shape on the ground,
so that a long thin queda de quattro becomes a short wide crouch when you
swing over.

We also did a bit of work on bananeira. Key point here was keep the arms
closer together --- much easier to maintain balance. The careful pressure
on palms and fingers to shift weight has a much better effect when the
arms are tight against the ears.

# 2013-06-06

Standing work: meia lua, esquiva and rasteira. Esquiva with the back to
the incoming meia lua. If the kick is off-balanced then move in for the
rasteira to the standing leg instead.

# 2013-06-11

First half of training focussed on getting upside down. Trying to travel
and land in a straight line rather than curving inwards with the landing
feet. Need to get body and legs more vertical to achieve this.

1.  From base, gliding hands to one side and another, then pushing off
    into bananeira.
2.  As above but ginga, esquiva to one side then glide over to the other
    for the bananeira.
3.  As above but while in bananeira swap the upright and forward legs back
    and forth forming a one-two kick sequence. Emphasise raising the
    lowered leg instead of lowering the vertical one in order to maintain
    balance.

From this foundation move on to a dynamic escorpiao.

1.  Attempt the kick like a rabo de arraia with one leg initially; the
    other can follow through later if necessary. Keep eye contact on the
    opponent. Opponent drops backward.
2.  The opponent drops on one foot, with the free leg on the side of the
    first kicker's head and aims for their face. The first kicker should
    try to push off their arms and away.

Second half of training looked at a takedown built on the transition from
queda de quatro to esquiva (jujitsu "[technical stand][1]", apparently). As
a sequence:

    Meia lua de frente            / Esquiva, to queda de quatro
    Rabo de arraia same direction / Role outside and re-enter
                                  \ Trap standing knee, pull back with ankle

The final step is a queda de quatro with the opponent's standing leg in
between your own. As the weight comes off this leg it becomes free to move
easily. With the weight on your inside leg and outside arm, pull the other
leg back taking the opponent's ankle with you. You should end in low
esquiva while they drop to the floor held by their other leg.

Important notes: The leg should be unweighted. You are trying to lower the
centre of gravity down to the ground rather than topple them. The pull
back should be straight, not twisting or trapping the knee. The inner leg
should just be there to stop the opponent moving it over your shin when
you start to pull through.

This appears to be some variant on a _banda_ (heel sweep).

# 2013-06-13

Arm plyometrics: from standing drop into a push up position and spring
back up to standing again. Also repeat to left and right side instead of
forward. Perform carefully.

Flow work with partners keeping up a constant rabo de arraia/esquiva rally
without breaking the chain. Trying to keep low throughout the sequence and
not bobbing down and up in the pendulum style.

Fast and hard rabo de arraia and back to a stable base. Aiming for the
fastest possible kick without compromising the finish.

Feints followed by cabecada. First the fake meia lua --- show the kick
with the hips then step forward with the "kicking" leg and through with
the head. Escape by facing sideways and moving the body weight back and
stepping out with the forward leg. Second the fake rab de arraia --- step
in with the support leg as if going to whip round then step through into
your partner. It may be best to just show the kick with the shoulders so
that the legs are not too committed to the rabo de arraia you don't want
to do, and can be properly marshalled to stepping into the person.

Repeat sequence from previous week:

    Meia lua de frente / step in with back to kick
    Esquiva backwards  \ cabecada
    Rabo de arraia     / Esquiva with unweighted leg under the kick
                       \ Step forward for cabecada

When the rabo de arraia comes put the leg under the kick but descend on
the nearest leg. You can quickly bring the side leg forward if it doesn't
have any body weight on it. The difficulty will be getting your body low
enough for a good cabecada.

Pandeiro rhythms! Start with regular shaking emphasised by a thumb hit on
the 1 beat. Then replace the 4 beat with a slap to give a nice
boom-sheky-sheky-slap! Finally every fourth bar there was a kind of double
slap thing that I haven't really remembered correctly so will need to get
clarified.

# 2013-06-18

Practising variations in the berimbau rhythms from the Angola base. An
important detail I hadn't really picked up on before was the central role
of the chi-chi in providing a backbone to the berimbau rhythms and
separating the different bars of regular and variant rhythms.

    xx O C - xx O C - xx O C - xx O C -   (1. standard)
    xx O C - xx O - C xx O C - xx O - C   (2. delayed closed note every 2nd)
    xx O C - xx OOOOO xx O C - xx OOOOO   (3. five open notes)
    xx O C - xx O - C xx OOOOO xx O C -   (4. combine 2 and 3)

# 2013-06-20

Two new songs which we played to a simple samba-like rhythm on the
pandeiro. Essentially just the 3-4 of the standard Angola pandeiro rhythm
repeated. Also tried a variant with shakes instead of finger-heel every
other bar. I am still totally incapable of stepping at the same time as
doing anything else, singing or playing instrument.

Second one is a bit faster and harder to get all the words out. "cair"
seems to rhyme with "Maria", something like "ka-yee-a". This version is
much longer than the one we were singing but includes all the elements I
think we were aiming towards.

A small one-sided sequence which is slowly added to over the class.

    Spin across and away
    Cabecada in
    Pull away
    Role over extended leg
    Small au across with double-leg push

# 2013-06-26 CDO with CM Papa Leguas

Fake a rabo de arraia by stepping across to create a standing leg then
immediately spinning around and away on the "kicking" leg. You're
ultimately stepping in and straight out again but describing an ellipse
around your trailing leg.

From a small queda de quatro, role over the left leg then continue under
the left leg without moving it, stepping the right leg fully through for
good balance. You should end up with the body facing right and your left
side facing upwards. From this position you can walk the feet around for
ponte, au, macaco etc.

When escaping rabo de arraia or other kick, spin round leaving
non-supporting leg curved towards the opponent. This gives better
positioning for executing a return rabo de arraia or kick from queda de
rins.

# 2013-07-09

A new guy called Patrick turned up after googling for capoeira so
hopefully he'll be back in future weeks. Piolho took the class but
adjusted slightly to make it more beginner-friendly. There was much less
terminology and more following actions by watching. Like the Papa Leguas
class I found this quite hard.

The new thing we were doing was a transition from a corta capim into a
rabo de arraia. Start in an esquiva to the side with both hands down,
like in starting blocks. Swing the extended leg round the front and when
it gets past half way place the hands shoulder-width apart in front and
kick off with the supporting leg, getting enough air that the extended leg
can spin right underneath. Use the spin to shift the body with it,
switching legs so the extended leg becomes the base and the jumping leg
whips round in a rabo de arraia.

Somehow I was doing something subtly different on my left and right side
so one side I was changing legs but the other side I was just following
through with the spinning leg as a rabo de arraia. Definitely needs more
work! Not to mention it's a killer on the legs.

# 2013-07-23

Revised a takedown defence which Mestre Marcelo Angola did at the weekend
workshop, on Friday.

	Rabo de arraia           / Negative
    Negativa                 \ Rabo de arraia
                             \ Step over negativa
                             \ Feet together inviting vingitiva
    Place foot for vingitiva / Drop down to wrap near foot round back
                             \ Bring other leg into their midriff and twist over

This is escaping the (prompted) vingitiva with a tesoura de costas.

There was also a berimbau rhythm that went something like donch-di donch-di donch,
which I think equates to: `OxC OxC Ox` though I don't know how the timing works.

# 2013-08-13

Took a week off for injuries received by rear-ending a Skoda. Had a gentle
start with lots of basics in this class. Felt a bit rusty and not very
strong. Apart from some nice singing the one thing I took away was the
easing the transition from a negativa to upright again. If the body is
tilted to one side with the hips facing forward there aren't any leg
muscles which can help you get up. Any transition puts a lot of strain on
legs and knees. If you first shift your hips so that you are side-on to
your partner the underneath leg has a much better chance of pushing you
upright.

# 2013-09-03

Lots of repetitions up and down the hall, to really kill your legs the
next day.

*   From legs together, esquiva by dropping straight down on supporting
    leg and pushing the other leg out to the side. Legs together and the
    same on the opposite side. Keep the head looking forward and in the
    same line as you advance down the hall.
*   As above but slide to the side/back with the supporting leg moving the
    most and the trailing leg sliding a bit. Move back to centre and
    esquiva quickly to the other side. (Do both these escapes after a meia
    lua for a more fluid transition between attack and defence.)

# 2013-08-12

Work on attack and defence with faster rabo de arraia and martelo. Also a

Ijexa rhythm which goes something like this on the atabaque:

    X XX O X  XX O X  XX O X

where X=slap and O=rim

# 2014-01-26 Two Rodas

First M&atilde;o No Ch&atilde;o charity roda of the year, for the Red
Cross Syriah appeal. The usual Cutting Room venue.

Senzala also had an event in "Shapes Studio" on Arther Street earlier in
the afternoon so I went in there too. I was the only non-Senzala person
but they were a friendly bunch and there were a few faces I recognised
from [the previous Glasgow Senzala
event](/posts/2013-11-09-roda-with-glasgow-senzala-and-professor-ourico.html).
I didn't manage to convince anyone to follow me on to the charity roda
but there were a few people who were at least interested in the concept
and impressed about the fundraising nature of it, so I think there may
be scope for outreach there.

I played gunga for a bit at the Senzala roda too --- definitely the
first time I'd felt confident enough to offer and let someone else play
a few games.

# 2014-01-27 Music session

It's been a couple months of radio silence but it seemed time to restart
this journal after it was mentioned in class.

Got together for a music session in the flat, playing together and
rotating through instruments. Sang a few songs which I knew in part but
it's good to concentrate on the details.

This next one I'm less sure about the lyrics and timing. I might have to
come back to it. I'm sure I've done it differently in the past.

Finally a totally new one for me, or at least one I didn't actually know
the lyrics for at all but have mumbled along in the past.

> | **Santo Antonio e Protetor**
> | 
> | Santo Antonio e protetor
> | Da barquinh&aacute; de Noel
> |
> | _Santo Antonio e protetor_

There were some other lyrics but I don't have them to hand.

Music wise the main thing I got out was concentrating on a clean entry.
Trying to keep the rhythm fixed in my head and letting my hands
independently deal with a call, then bringing the two together at the
right moment. Not easy but I felt like I made a step up within the last
week. No doubt it will disappear next time I try it.

Freezing cold training session in the Overnewton. Recently we've been
working on stepping in/spinning out and curling round. Part of this I
remember being [very briefly covered by CM Papa
Leguas](#cdo-with-cm-papa-leguas). It's still not any easier after all
this time.

We moved onto partner work combining ben&ccedil;ao and evasions by
bending backwards. I still think I'm a long way from being able to
instinctively pull this one off in a game but it felt much easier than
it has in the past.

    Bencao / Back bend and drop to floor, one foot flat
           \ Rasteira opponent's kicking leg from ground

The hardest part was evading underneath the kicking leg rather than away
so that I was still in a good position to attempt the rasteira.

# 2014-03-27 Dion

First class back after skiing holiday and a cold. Felt pretty rusty and as usual felt way out of my depth in Dion's classes.

There was a lot of emphasis on ginga, expressive movement and having a self-expressive approach to capoeira which I'm always called out for not having.

*    Ginga opposite your partner maintaining a steady position and distance. The guide for this was to have one person hook their hand into the front of the belt of the other person. Also there was some "ginga on broken glass" and "drunken master ginga" metaphors.
*    With the ginga add in a "cheeky rasteira" (probably not a legit technical term) with the outside of the foot on the same side as the foot you're sweeping. So the outside of your right foot would catch the inside of their left foot to unbalance in the ginga.
*    The person having their foot swept can go with the motion, using the sweep to spin round on the other leg and perform a chapa with the leg that was being rasteira'd.

A slight change of tack next with meia lua de frente and cabe&ccedil;ada, though it still works into the same spin-to-chapa from the previous sequence.

    Meia lua de frente / Esquiva, return to centre
    Cabe&ccedil;ada / Step back, turn
                    \ Chapa

The "step back, turn" step was tricky enough that I don't think I got it right. It was a kind of half turn and then that intertwining leg thing to bring the weight under the other leg, so the leg furthest away can be used for the kick. 

Next were intertwining sequences of meia lua, front and back:

    Meia lua de frente, step across /
                                    \ meia lua de costas

Other things: fast, solid au, getting through the arc with as little trunk movement as possible. With a solid trunk you're not only more stable in the case of being pushed but you can come back up quicker. This seems a good one to train. Also some more ponte stuff which I'm still totally terrible at.

# 2015-02-21 Mestre Fantasma workshop, Edinburgh

First time I've been to a workshop with one apparent focus, in this case observation of the other player. The session involved a progressive resistance of analysing the ginga and sweeping the foot at the right moment. At the end of the day was a training roda to put the training in to practice, but not to ignore the training entirely and play a normal game. 

It was pretty taxing. One of the hardest parts was getting into the mindset of co-operative resistance, which is common at the BJJ class but quite unusual for capoeira --- in fact I think this was the first time I've seen it explicitly emphasised. It was clear that many people struggled getting in to this mindset because it is so different. Having Fantasma's students, Tim and SJ, demonstrate what was meant at the end of the Saturday class made it clear how wrong we had been getting it, even as we were working towards the right thing. As soon as you get into the situation of a roda then the history of everything you've learned takes over and over-rides the bit you're supposed to be working on.

# 2015-04-07: Querido de Deus class, Edinburgh

Senzala hosted a guest instructor for a few days and we attended his Tuesday class instead of running our own class. It was a really good class though as usual went on for way over the advertised time. Capoeira is just not the activity for people who have day jobs...

Did some musical/vocal exercises, singing the same songs "normally", rhythmically (no emphasis on melody) and melodically (trying to get as much soul from the song as possible). Much throwing around of the words 'key', 'harmony', 'octave' and so on. Well I had a cold so I couldn't even sing to my normal low standard.

Next some rabo de arraia switching left and right, with the defender escaping and being followed in the usual fashion. Key detail was the importance of foot placement as setup for what comes after the esquiva. If you put your foot forward then whether it is inside or outside dictates whether you next direction is into (attack) or away from your opponent. The other detail was one of the attacker letting the defender move as quickly as they want: if they esquiva one way then role in the other they can turn and "re-open" themselves to the kick they were trying to escape.

This is one instance of the principle mentioned of the "triangle of vulnerability": the underbelly of the capoeirista when they have 3 limbs on the floor. Following where this vulnerable area is --- and predicting where it will appear --- is very valuable.
