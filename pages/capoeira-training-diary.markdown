I'm just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I'm using
forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:

    Question / Response
    Defence  \ Attack

The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a
situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two
players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.

Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and
variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are
played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.


    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
    O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
    C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular

Ginga with "breaks" --- _giro_ (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish),
_pulo_ (jump, from side to side), _chamada_ (facing off to one side, legs
together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).

Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then
entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then
drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the
other side.

Sequence:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
    Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia

Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead
staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change
direction until Left's foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to
turn into a chapa.

Variant 1:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Variant 2:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Right's QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs
to protect before spreading for the tesoura.

Practise ginga: with a firm base and a light expressive top half; and with
an agile, light base and a solid top half.

Quite an intricate sequence starting from a chapa as a response to a fairly
open meia lua. The defender performs an esquiva in the same direction as the
kick, followed by a chapa (a) with the following leg, keeping weight where
it is, or (b) bringing the following leg in and kicking backwards with the
standing leg. (NB that (a) is close to but shouldn't turn into gancho --- be
more direct!)

    Meia lua               / Esquiva
    Jump back to negativa  \ Chapa (either leg)
    S-dobrado              / giro or au or ...

Defending the chapa is where it gets tricky. Moving from meia lua to leaping
back, shifting the weight and the rotation in the opposite direction. The
end position is a half-squat with the former kicking foot flat on the ground
and the standing leg outstretched on the ground. Making sure you're not
landing hand-first as you're quickly going to really hurt your wrist.

Moving round in a circle --- walking forwards, backwards, deep lunging
steps, on all fours forwards, backwards, forwards but *really* low
(killer).

Fall back on one leg, the other forward, and au on the side of the forward
leg. Try to step from one hand to the other with the au.

Queda de tres with the supported side towards your opponent. Push off with
both feet and jump to the front, supported on your planted hand. Repeat
but the jump becomes a two-footed kick.

Small au stops midway and expands. Drop straight down so you are facing
the opposite way and repeat on the other side.

Sequence 1:

Simple sequence moving forward with tesoura and au, moving over the
opponent and asking a question --- as simple or as difficult as you want
to make it.

    Tesoura                      / Au, drop into queda de rins
    Au, drop into queda de rins  \ Tesoura

Sequence 2:

Another simple sequence. The first rabo de arraia just has to be enough to
force the esquiva. With enough skill it can just be a flick of the hips...

    Feint rabo de arraia                  / Esquiva
    Switch & rabo de arraia opposite side / Esquiva

Variations on _Chama eu Angola_, citing Pastinha or Besouro instead of
Angola.

| Chama eu, chama eu
| Chama eu Angola, chama eu

### 2013-04-19

Gentle ginga to warm up. With foot in rear position lower down into crouch
with rear foot on toe and front foot flat. Should be stable and mobile,
ready for esquiva, turn sideways, au etc. Stand and repeat on other side:
ginga then drop into crouch, rise again. Alternately, rise into a low base
without ginga, then into crouch; really hit those thighs hard.

When in crouch, role round the forward leg, keeping quite small and tight
rather than stretching the leg out. Repeat in both directions. In role
mid-point push backwards with both hands so you pivot over the anchored
leg and use the aerial leg to land in the same crouch position facing the
opposite way from your start position. (Can be done with two people
sliding past each other and repositioning around the perimeter of a small
circle.)

Esquiva with one hand down, bring feet together and spread feet again
facing the opposite direction. Protect and keep an eye on your partner
through your legs, switch to the other side. The forward leg is the
straight(er) leg as you drop into a crouch, side on to partner. From there
you can role into into tesoura or rabo de arraia.

A new song:

| **Sobrado de Mam&atilde;e**
|
| O sobrado de mam&atilde;e &eacute; debaixo d'&aacute;gua
| O sobrado de mam&atilde;e &eacute; debaixo d'&aacute;gua
| Debaixo d'&aacute;gua por cima da areia
|
| _Tem ouro, tem prata_
| _Tem diamante que nos alumeia_

Notes from a charity roda.

*   Need to work on controlling level of engagment (ie 1,2,3) where 1 is
    only exploratory and not combative. Work on letting people move rather
    than always blocking. Encourage the flow of conversation rather than
    obstructing it. Spend more time having fun, collaborating...?
*   Related to that, work on the interplay between leading and following:
    learning to notice when I'm following (most of the time) and see if I
    do something about that.
