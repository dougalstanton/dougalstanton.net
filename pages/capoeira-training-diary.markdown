I'm just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I'm using
forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:

    Question / Response
    Defence  \ Attack

The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a
situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two
players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.

Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and
variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are
played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.


    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
    O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
    C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular

Ginga with "breaks" --- _giro_ (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish),
_pulo_ (jump, from side to side), _chamada_ (facing off to one side, legs
together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).

Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then
entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then
drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the
other side.

Sequence:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
    Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia

Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead
staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change
direction until Left's foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to
turn into a chapa.

Variant 1:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Variant 2:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Right's QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs
to protect before spreading for the tesoura.

    Meia lua               / Esquiva
    Jump back to negativa  \ Chapa (either leg)
    S-dobrado              / giro or au or ...
