I'm just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I'm using
forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:

    Question / Response
    Defence  \ Attack

The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a
situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-)

Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and
variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are 
played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.


    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
    O C #   O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
    C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular

Ginga with "breaks" --- _giro_ (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish), _pulo_ (jump, from side to side), _chamada_ (facing off to one side, legs together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).

Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then
entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then
drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the
other side.

Sequence:

    Raba de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Raba de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
    Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia

Variant 1:

    Raba de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Raba de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
    Over or under as required     \ Tesouro

Variant 2:

    Raba de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Raba de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
    Over or under as required     \ Tesouro
