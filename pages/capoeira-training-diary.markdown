I'm just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I'm using
forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:

    Question / Response
    Defence  \ Attack

The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a
situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two
players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.

### 2013-03-21

Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and
variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are
played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.


    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
    O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
    C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular

Ginga with "breaks" --- _giro_ (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish),
_pulo_ (jump, from side to side), _chamada_ (facing off to one side, legs
together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).

Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then
entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then
drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the
other side.

Sequence:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
    Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia

Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead
staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change
direction until Left's foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to
turn into a chapa.

Variant 1:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Variant 2:

    Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
    Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
    Over or under as required     \ Tesoura

Right's QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs
to protect before spreading for the tesoura.


### 2013-04-04

Practise ginga: with a firm base and a light expressive top half; and with
an agile, light base and a solid top half.

Quite an intricate sequence starting from a chapa as a response to a fairly
open meia lua. The defender performs an esquiva in the same direction as the
kick, followed by a chapa (a) with the following leg, keeping weight where
it is, or (b) bringing the following leg in and kicking backwards with the
standing leg. (NB that (a) is close to but shouldn't turn into gancho --- be
more direct!)

    Meia lua               / Esquiva
    Jump back to negativa  \ Chapa (either leg)
    S-dobrado              / giro or au or ...

Defending the chapa is where it gets tricky. Moving from meia lua to leaping
back, shifting the weight and the rotation in the opposite direction. The
end position is a half-squat with the former kicking foot flat on the ground
and the standing leg outstretched on the ground. Making sure you're not
landing hand-first as you're quickly going to really hurt your wrist.


### 2013-04-12

Moving round in a circle --- walking forwards, backwards, deep lunging
steps, on all fours forwards, backwards, forwards but *really* low
(killer).

Fall back on one leg, the other forward, and au on the side of the forward
leg. Try to step from one hand to the other with the au.

Queda de tres with the supported side towards your opponent. Push off with
both feet and jump to the front, supported on your planted hand. Repeat
but the jump becomes a two-footed kick.

Small au stops midway and expands. Drop straight down so you are facing
the opposite way and repeat on the other side.

Sequence 1:

Simple sequence moving forward with tesoura and au, moving over the
opponent and asking a question --- as simple or as difficult as you want
to make it.

    Tesoura                      / Au, drop into queda de rins
    Au, drop into queda de rins  \ Tesoura

Sequence 2:

Another simple sequence. The first rabo de arraia just has to be enough to
force the esquiva. With enough skill it can just be a flick of the hips...

    Feint rabo de arraia                  / Esquiva
    Switch & rabo de arraia opposite side / Esquiva

Variations on _Chama eu Angola_, citing Pastinha or Besouro instead of
Angola.

| Chama eu, chama eu
| Chama eu Angola, chama eu

### 2013-04-19

Gentle ginga to warm up. With foot in rear position lower down into crouch
with rear foot on toe and front foot flat. Should be stable and mobile,
ready for esquiva, turn sideways, au etc. Stand and repeat on other side:
ginga then drop into crouch, rise again. Alternately, rise into a low base
without ginga, then into crouch; really hit those thighs hard.

When in crouch, role round the forward leg, keeping quite small and tight
rather than stretching the leg out. Repeat in both directions. In role
mid-point push backwards with both hands so you pivot over the anchored
leg and use the aerial leg to land in the same crouch position facing the
opposite way from your start position. (Can be done with two people
sliding past each other and repositioning around the perimeter of a small
circle.)

Esquiva with one hand down, bring feet together and spread feet again
facing the opposite direction. Protect and keep an eye on your partner
through your legs, switch to the other side. The forward leg is the
straight(er) leg as you drop into a crouch, side on to partner. From there
you can role into into tesoura or rabo de arraia.

A new song:

| **Sobrado de Mam&atilde;e**
|
| O sobrado de mam&atilde;e &eacute; debaixo d'&aacute;gua
| O sobrado de mam&atilde;e &eacute; debaixo d'&aacute;gua
| Debaixo d'&aacute;gua por cima da areia
|
| _Tem ouro, tem prata_
| _Tem diamante que nos alumeia_


### 2013-04-21 Charity roda

*   Need to work on controlling level of engagment (ie 1,2,3) where 1 is
    only exploratory and not combative. Work on letting people move rather
    than always blocking. Encourage the flow of conversation rather than
    obstructing it. Spend more time having fun, collaborating...?
*   Related to that, work on the interplay between leading and following:
    learning to notice when I'm following (most of the time) and see if I
    do something about that.

### 2013-04-26

Some work on low ginga, moving slowly and maintaining a constant distance
and connection from each other. I really need to work on this sense of
flow and constant movement alongside the connectivity: it seems to be one
or another at the moment.

Kicking practice --- rabo de arraia, rabo de arraia sem m&atilde;o and
armada. Particular emphasis on minimising telegraph with rabo de arraia by
not stepping forward but spinning from the base of the ginga. Also armada
followed by bananeira on each side.

Sequence (might have been two mixed together, can't remember)

    Negativa left
    Swing foot in front and negativa to the right
    Bananeira to the right
    Land on right foot, step in with left foot
    Rabo de arraia with right foot

### 2013-05-02 First class in Overnewton

Injured left side so just played pandeiro and sang. Things to concentrate
on w.r.t. music:

*   Singing at the right time so the boom-ba matches up with the
    lyrics which typically contain a da-da rhythm themselves. Or remember
    at which point the singing is supposed to start. :-\
*   Getting the correct pitch for _Bahia de todos os santos_, particularly
    for the second line of each verse which goes up.

### 2013-05-09 Dion's class in Airdrie

Flexibility work: forward splits, rotation to forward splits facing the
other direction. Half ponte and straight-legged stretch (like a half ponte
or role but with legs out straight in a wide V, heels on the ground).

Flow work: moving across the ground with role/ginga, stop into bananeira, and
back to moving again.

Rabo de arraia then step back into bananeira. Upright alternative: rabo de
arraia then bring knee of kicking leg up and through. A knee, or a
threatened chapa, or a defence.

Chamada-style head-to-belly stance. Upright person leads and crouched
person has to follow while maintaining constant connection.

One person breaks into the other person's meia lua with a decisive butt to
the sternum. Hands up to protect on side of incoming leg.

    Meia lua de frente / cabecada

### 2013-05-11 Dion's workshop in Drumnadrochit

Lots of mobility work and relaxation emphasis. Ginga, "crocodile"
(travelling tesoura move, head and body low to ground), "lizard" (similar
but forward, with upward bend every few paces), "elephant"
(straight-legged backwards walk with body folded double and short steps).

Tesoura. Tesoura and au with one protecting from cabecada.

### 2013-05-24 Revision of Dion's teachings

Piolho away; Nick taking us through some of the work that Dion was doing
with us. In no particular order:

*   Ginga work. Two phases: the first ignores the body and concentrates on
    the legs, keeping things solid and deliberate.
    
    Exercises included (i) always being open (wide-legged stance, no
    crossing legs over), (ii) always crossing legs over (much spinning and
    standing with legs together, (iii) "exploration" of space by
    maintaining all your weight on the support leg until the last moment
    and then switching to the other leg.
    
    Second phase was to concentrate on upper half leaving legs alone to do
    their thing: sway first from the hips, then moving from the waist and
    chest, then finally bringing the shoulders and head in, to the point
    of leading with the head (chin first?).
*   Ponte work. Ponte rotation along a wall, choosing a horizontal line to
    follow and then return other way. Increase difficulty by choosing a
    lower line on the wall and placing your feet further from the wall. In
    essence, moving the body towards horizontal.

    Attempting similar moves from the ground. Lying back bring feet up
    underneath and take weight onto head/shoulders to get hands onto the
    ground and holding some weight.

    Otherwise starting from queda de rins take weight on head and try to
    spin hand on ground to be positioned "backwards".
*   Progressive cabecada and au, maintaining contact with the head
    throughout the au. Concentrate on the opponent not the ground during
    au!

Other thoughts for the lesson: think about decisiveness. Choosing whether
to go for a move or not, or to fake a move or not.

### 2013-05-30

As the previous week, revising things that Dion was teaching but from
Piolho's perspective this time.

*   Weight placement. Esquiva to one leg so that all of the weight is
    directly above it (don't twist the knee). Sinking on that knee while
    leaving the toes of the trailing foot on the ground leaves the
    greatest range of movement open. (If the weight is evenly distributed
    you have to shift it all in one direction to do anything.)

    Two ways of doing this. Either sink directly on leg while moving the
    other leg "out" (as if stepping under a kick). Or stepping back with
    the leg which will hold your weight and letting it collapse down. In
    both situations one leg takes all the weight, but the difference is
    whether it is the leg which moves or the leg that remains static.

    The direction of movement is also variable. With the weight on the
    static leg, moving forward allows you to esquiva under a kick or set
    up a rasteira. With the weight on the moving leg, moving forward
    is more like a cabecada while moving backward is a definite esquiva.

    Thinking about these moves had a positive effect on my game I felt and
    on my reactivity.

*   Cabecada. One exercise leaning head against partner's stomach, each
    leaning into the other similar to the chamada. Letting the bending
    person's head push the other around, keeping a straight back and neck.

    The other exercise is a meia lua interrupted by a cabecada to the
    sternum. Things to concentrate on include *slighty* turning away from
    the kicking leg for protection, and getting a good solid connection
    and push on the centre of the chest.

Sequence:

Things brings together a lot of the elements from above. The kick
interrupted by the cabecada, but this time Left receives the head with an
esquiva, stepping back and down onto the back leg, then switching weight
to the front leg to use back leg to kick. Right brings their back leg *in*
so both legs are together then drops their weight to "esquiva through"
underneath the rabo de arraia. (It is possible to step out to the side and
come back in with the cabecada instead of going inside.)

    Meia lua de frente / interrupt kick
    Esquiva backwards  \ with cabecada
    Rabo de arraia     / Esquiva
                       \ Step inside (or cabecada)

Done well this sequence has a nice sense of distance and elasticity though
I always end up too close at the end when stepping inside, which negates
the need for the cabecada but isn't so flexible or elegant.

And the lyrics to a couple of songs. This first one can also be _Angoleiro
sou eu_ instead of _Capoeira sou eu_. I don't know about the verses.

| **Quem vem l&aacute;? --- Sou eu**
|
| Quem vem la? Sou eu
| Quem vem la? Sou eu
| Berimbau bateu
| Capoeira sou eu

Second song, again no verse lyrics, sorry...

| **Bal&atilde;o subiu, bal&atilde;o desceu**
|
| Balao subiu
| Balao desceu
