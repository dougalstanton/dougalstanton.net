Training "canned" sequences to the point we would be comfortable doing
them in public.

Providing background information to the game, a full education rather than
just a demonstration which is quite opaque and inscrutable to watch.

Getting together to examine videos of games, either Mao Tudo DVD (the
Dion/Lucio flow work?) or other content from the internet. Get other
people's views on the games, have people point out things you cannot see.

Take up classes in other things to learn other ways to move. Judo,
gymnastics, Contact Improvisation (Contact Jam?) and probably others.
