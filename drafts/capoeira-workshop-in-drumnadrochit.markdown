At the weekend I was up north with Helen and a number of other people from
_M&atilde;o no Ch&atilde;o Capoeira Angola_. The [group's founder,
Dion][1], was over from Greece to take the weekend workshop.

We took a car up on Friday, leaving only two hours behind schedule (a
record of punctuality where we are concerned). I had enough time to bake a
loaf of bread to take, but not enough space in the car to pack a tent. We
even had some of the half-done berimbaus from the instrument-making
session strapped to the roof rack.

We drove to Inverness, gathered some supplies and then switched south
again on the other side of Loch Ness to Drumnadrochit for pizza and chips
before heading to Fraser's house on the shore of Loch Meiklie. Helen got
the train into Inverness and we picked her up later that evening. 

We all slept on the floor of Fraser's living room that night because it
was too wet to think about putting the tent up. I didn't find the sleeping
bag and mat much of a problem and slept reasonably well. I think I was
woken by a slobbery dog on at least one of the days --- the perils of
lying on the ground.

After a lazy breakfast we put some more work into the instruments we'd
brought with us. Then it was a bit of lunch and down to Glenurquhart
Public Hall in Drumnadrochit for the Saturday afternoon of training. In
the evening Fraser's wife brought down big pans full of curry and rice
which we had in the hall, in the well-appointed kitchen attached. If
you're looking for a venue up that way I can really recommend it on
facilities (I have no idea how much it cost).

I was still quite sore from my mysterious muscle injury in my side (see
previous post) --- I wouldn't work out what it was until the Sunday --- so
I was taking things easy and not doing a lot of the inverted stuff or
anything which required stretching my arms behind me. Which is unfortunate
because there was a heavy emphasis on [ponte] [2] which is basically all
about being inverted, stretching arms behind you and taking your weight on
them.

After class and the meal Helen and I nipped round the village to get some
air and stopped in at [Fiddlers] [3] for a sly half pint --- sitting
in the beer garden in what was left of the sunshine.
