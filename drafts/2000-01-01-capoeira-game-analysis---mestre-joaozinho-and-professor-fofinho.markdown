It's common knowledge that you can learn a lot by watching experts and for anyone who wants to learn physical activities then online video is a goldmine of "experts at work".

I've been watching capoeira videos online since I started going to capoeira classes but I have never taken a very analytical approach. Just as there is a difference between watching a movie to enjoy the story and watching a movie to learn the techniques of filmmaking, it's worthwhile to stop sometimes and really see the details of what is happening.

I'm going to look at a game featuring Mestre Joaozinho da Figueira and Professor Fofinho (the latter name comes from one of the comments). I chose it because the video quality is good and the action is close to the camera --- and the game itself has a nice mix of expression and action.

First, why not watch the game all the way through if you've not seen it already?

There's three "rallies" in particular that I wanted to highlight about this game.

The first begins at 2:38 with a sweep attempt by Joaozinho. Both players square up again at this point and Fofinho starts a low ginga. Joaozinho fakes a low kick but catches his foot on the ground to stall the momentum. Fofinho jumps backwards and ends in queda de tres where he springs back with a martelo.

rasteiras - martelo -> rabo de arraia

crowd - esquiva + au - rasteira (cf 1:58) -> rabo de arraia

rabo de arraia - clamp
