Since starting BJJ it's been harder to remain disconnected from people when playing capoeira. Either I can fight this or embrace it and see where it leads.

Against a meia lua or rabo de arraia it makes sense to have contact with the kicking leg while moving out of the way. In particular slower kicks which can be easily reused to kick from different directions. Ducking under a meia lua puts the face quite close to the kicking leg and it's not uncommon for the person to shift their weight and come back with the foot right towards your face.

The traditional reaction would be to protect the face with your hands but this is actually pretty difficult against a committed force. A boxer is strong enough to push your own hands into your face; a kick is obviously considerably stronger. So then another solution is to close with the kicking leg --- follow the leg as it passes with the hands. This minimises the distance over which the secondary kick winds up; if you actually touch the leg it cuts that distance to effectively zero. On top of that it provides an instant tactile feedback to the other person's intentions without relying on the eyes.
