We honeymooned in Italy, and for 5 days of that we had hire bikes to ride around Umbria. The group we organised this through, and who would move our luggage from place to place every day, gave us GPX files to follow. I carefully converted this files into Strava routes which we could follow, only to discover on the very first morning as we set off that Strava doesn't do offline route following. It's perfectly happy to record your GPS location without a data connection, but it won't try to start a route. In desperation I tried standing within WiFi distance of the hotel in order to press "start".

On the last day they sent us a supplementary route, to get from the last "cycling" hotel to the "singing holiday" hotel. Without a computer it was not even possible to massage the GPX file into a Strava route. We discovered an alternative in the guise of GPX Viewer (Android app) which reads GPX routes natively and will let you overlay the results on one of a number of terrain maps. So you can overlay the GPX route on a Google Maps display - and you can download an area of Google Maps for offline use. Between the two you can navigate using only GPS.

Of course at about this point the new laws about roaming charges in the EU came in, so turning on the data connection would become a viable choice. However parts of rural Italy had very limited mobile connectivity of any kind so expecting high-speed data availability is not always realistic.
