On the 1st of November I finish my job working at Honeywell Security
Group and will be moving to Calnex Solutions. I don't yet know what my
new role will involve, only in the broadest of terms. Whatever comes up
during discussions at interview is only ever the simplest explanation
that fits the moment. The devil is in the details.

I will be commuting further (but faster, so the distance won't make much
difference). Eventually we hope to return to our home in Edinburgh, if
Helen and I end up working on the east coast. I will still be travelling
by bike and I hope the environment will be nicer!

I had my leaving do on Friday though I'm still at work for the rest of
the week. I hope to keep in touch with some of the people there and
maybe see them over Christmas for a chat in the pub or similar.

But in the mean time I will have to get used to a new routine with the
pain of settling into a new job, learning new things and so forth. Wish
me luck.
