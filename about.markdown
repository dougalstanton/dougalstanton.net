title: All About Me
---
My name's Dougal. I live in Glasgow in the rainy west coast of Scotland and write software for a living. When not at a computer I like [playing capoeira] [1] and baking bread. (Anyone interested in that should seek out Richard Bertinet's first book, _Dough_.) I have dabbled in British Sign Language in the past but I no longer get a chance to practise so it's all disappearing, like my secondary school French.

Professionally I have been involved in embedded development in C and C++. In my spare time I dabble in Haskell and reading up on the things which learning Haskell has thrown my way: type systems, category theory, abstract algebras, program calculation and proof by construction, etc.

If you want to get in touch about this blog or any particular entries, just email `dougal` at this domain. For recruitment please see [my LinkedIn profile][2] for information and contact details or [have a look at my CV](/cv.html).
