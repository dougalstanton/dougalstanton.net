Some of my projects, under current development, "finished" or defunct.

# Capoeira

I train with [Mao No Chao Scotland](http://www.maonochao.org) and keep
some notes here of things I've learned.

*   [Training diary](/pages/capoeira-training-diary.html)
*   [Song lyrics](/pages/capoeira-songs.html)
*   [Rhythms](/pages/capoeira-rhythms.html)

# BJJ

I train with [Cross Combat](http://crosscombat.co.uk) and try to keep notes/thoughts here from the classes.

# Code etc.

I maintain a [GitHub repository](http://github.com/dougalstanton) with
some hobby projects.

*   [ComicBake](/pages/comicbake.html): for writing quick comics
*   [Git Checklist](/pages/git-checklist.html): for tracking TODOs in
    coding projects (or anything else you store in a git repository).
*   Unix scripts & tools ([repo](http://github.com/dougalstanton/scripts))
*   Functional Programming talk about code reuse of control flow
    constructs

I still have a number of projects which were online before but for now
just live on my computer, waiting for the disk to catastrophically
crash. I should probably do something about that.
