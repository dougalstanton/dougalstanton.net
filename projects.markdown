Some of my projects, under current development, "finished" or defunct.

*   Capoeira with [Mao No Chao Scotland](http://www.maonochao.org)
    *   [Training diary](/pages/capoeira-training-diary.html)
    *   [Song lyrics](/pages/capoeira-songs.html)
    *   [Rhythms](/pages/capoeira-rhythms.html)
*   [GitHub repository](http://github.com/dougalstanton)
    *   [ComicBake](/pages/comicbake.html): for writing quick comics
    *   Functional Programming talk about code reuse of control flow
        constructs

I still have a number of projects which were online before but for now
just live on my computer, waiting for the disk to catastrophically
crash. I should probably do something about that.
